## If I don't run multiple commands all that often, does shrun hold any value?

`shrun` offers several advantages over running raw commands, beyond concurrency.

- Desktop notifications means we can "fire-and-forget" commands. That is, we can run a command in one window, switch windows/desktops to do something else, then be notified when the command finishes. Otherwise we have to manually switch back to check if the command finished, which is mildly annoying.

- Automatic file logging often makes debugging failures easier. It is usually easier searching a file for relevant logs, as opposed to scrolling (possibly large) terminal output. The `--file-log-delete-on-success` option makes this workflow even nicer, as we do not leave log files around unless something goes wrong.

- Having a running timer is useful when we have some idea how long a command _should_ take. Not to mention it is psychologically reassuring ðŸ™‚.

## What if a command needs sudo?

Commands _can_ receive `stdin`, so running e.g. `shrun "sudo some command"` will launch the sudo prompt. From there we can type the password and hit `enter` as usual.

However this is a bit clunky as the timer text will overwrite the `[sudo] password for ...` prompt, and multiple commands add more complication.

It is therefore easiest to run sudo first to elevate privileges, then execute `shrun` as normal e.g.

```sh
# Run sudo with some dummy command
$ sudo ls
...

# shrun can now execute sudo without requiring stdin
$ shrun ...
```

## What if my command relies on interactive shell?

Shrun executes shell commands non-interactively, which means we do not have access to anything defined in, say, `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`. This can be annoying if we want to run any of these functions/aliases.

```sh
# ~/.bashrc
foo () {
  ...
}

bar () {
  ...
}
```

```sh
$ shrun foo bar
[Error][bar] 0 seconds: /bin/sh: line 1: bar: command not found
[Error][foo] 0 seconds: /bin/sh: line 1: foo: command not found
[Finished] 0 seconds
```

Fortunately, the [`init`](configuration.md#init) option exists exactly for this purpose:

```sh
$ shrun --init ". ~/.bashrc" foo bar
```

This is equivalent to running:

```sh
$ shrun ". ~/.bashrc && foo" ". ~/.bashrc && bar"
```

> [!TIP]
>
> An extensive `~/.bashrc` may contain code that does not work well when loading non-interactively e.g. the common idiom `[[ $- == *i* ]] || return` will cause `shrun` to choke. Instead, you may want to create a file for your functions e.g. `~/.bash_functions.sh`, source _that_ in `~/.bashrc`, and then use it with `shrun` instead:
>
> ```sh
> $ shrun --init ". ~/.bash_functions.sh" ...

## Init vs. Legend

There are two ways to use command aliases with `shrun`. One is with the toml file's [`legend`](./configuration.md#legend) section:

```toml
legend = [
  { key = 'backend', val = 'javac ...' },
]
```

```sh
# runs javac as a shrun command
$ shrun -c config.toml backend
```

Another is with [`init`](configuration.md#init):

```sh
# e.g. define as bash alias/function instead in ~/.bashrc or wherever
backend () { javac ...; }
```

```sh
# runs the bash 'backend' function as a shrun command
$ shrun --init ". ~/.bashrc" backend
```

Why two methods?

1. The first reason is historical: `legend` preceded `init`, so for a time the former was the only way to use aliases with `shrun`.

2. More importantly, the legend allows us to easily combine _multiple_ commands and keep `shrun`'s usual semantics (e.g. concurrency, independence):

    ```toml
    legend = [
      { key = 'backend', val = 'javac ...' },
      { key = 'ui', val = 'npm run build' },
      { key = 'all', val = ['backend', 'ui'] },
    ]
    ```

    ```sh
    # runs ui and backend concurrently
    $ shrun -c config.toml all
    ```

    On the other hand, the naive bash translation has different semantics:

    ```sh
    backend () { javac ...; }

    ui () { npm run build; }

    all () { backend; ui; }
    ```

    ```sh
    # runs the bash 'all' function as a shrun command, so backend and ui are
    # _not_ run concurrently / separately!
    $ shrun --init ". ~/.bashrc" all
    ```

    Of course you _can_ write concurrent bash code. But the problem of running multiple commands was in fact `shrun`'s [motivating example](README.md#motivation).

Thus the conclusion is: If you have a single alias that you may want global (e.g. called with or without `shrun`), and you do not envision regularly running that alias simultaneously with other commands, by all means, throw it in e.g. `~/.bashrc` and use `init`.

If, instead, you don't want the alias in `~/.bashrc` or you regularly run it with some other commands, consider putting it in the toml's `legend`.

> [!TIP]

> You can also split the difference here. Put the individual commands `backend` and `ui` in `~/.bashrc`, load that with `init`, and put the aggregate `all` command in `legend`. This allows using `backend` and `ui` independent of `shrun`, while retaining `shrun`'s advantages with `all`:

## Bash auto-completions

To get bash auto-completions for `shrun` options, add the following to your `.bashrc` (assuming `shrun` is on the `PATH`):

```sh
. <(shrun --bash-completion-script `which shrun`)
```
